# System Description – uponorX265

Home Assistant custom integration that connects to an **Uponor Smatrix Pulse** gateway over the local network and exposes the heating/cooling system's thermostats, controllers, and gateway as HA entities. All communication happens locally (`iot_class: local_polling`) — no cloud involved.

## Architecture

### Communication layer — [jnap.py](custom_components/uponorx265/jnap.py)
`UponorJnap` speaks JNAP (JSON Network API) to the gateway's `/JNAP/` endpoint via `aiohttp`. Two operations: `get_data()` (fetches all variables as a flat dict `waspVarName → waspVarValue`) and `send_data()` (writes variables). Built-in retry logic (2 attempts, 1s delay) and a shared timeout; network errors are converted to `HomeAssistantError`.

### State layer — [__init__.py](custom_components/uponorx265/__init__.py)
`UponorStateProxy` is the central class: keeps the raw data (`_data`) in memory, polls the gateway on `SCAN_INTERVAL` (30s), and exposes typed getters/setters (`get_setpoint`, `async_set_target_temperature`, `get_bypass_enable`, etc.) that the platform files build entities from. On every update, `SIGNAL_UPONOR_STATE_UPDATE` is sent via HA's dispatcher so all entities update at once. Data is also cached in `Store` (per config entry) for fast restarts. The module also registers the integration's services (`set_variable`, `dump_hardware_info`, `dump_raw_data`).

### Gateway ID (MAC address) — [__init__.py](custom_components/uponorx265/__init__.py)
The gateway's `device_info` identifier is based on its MAC address when it can be resolved, otherwise it falls back to a host-based ID (the IP address with dots stripped).

`UponorStateProxy.async_resolve_gateway_id()` is a JNAP round trip, so `async_setup_entry` only awaits it **on a first setup** — the path that already awaits the first poll, and the only one where `get_gateway_id()` has nothing better than the host form to give `device_info` during platform setup.

A cached start skips it. Caching thermostats exists so entities come back after a restart while the gateway is still booting, and awaiting the network there would put an ~8-second timeout (three attempts at a 2s connect timeout, plus backoff) in front of every entity whenever the gateway is unreachable. It is also redundant: a cached start means the entry has been set up before, so `_get_registered_gateway_id()` has already read the identifier the gateway device is registered under and `get_gateway_id()` returns exactly that. The backgrounded poll resolves the real MAC and `_async_retry_gateway_id()` migrates the registry if it ever differs, so a changed or never-resolved id still converges — just without holding up setup.

The MAC is **read from the gateway**, not inferred from the network: the JNAP core action `http://phyn.com/jnap/core/GetDeviceInfo` reports it as `deviceID` (e.g. `AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF`), which is uppercased and stripped of colons before being used as the ID. The same response carries the gateway's printed serial number, hardware version and firmware (`firmwareNumber`, the value the Uponor app displays) — none of which appear anywhere in the `uponorsky/GetAttributes` variable set, because that set describes the controllers and thermostats *behind* the comm module rather than the module itself. See "Gateway device info" below.

If the gateway does not report a `deviceID`, a previously registered stable identifier is retained; a new installation uses the host-based form. Neither fallback is cached as a confirmed result, so later polls keep retrying and `_async_retry_gateway_id()` repairs the registry once a real MAC arrives.

> **Historical note.** Until this was found, the MAC was resolved with `getmac` plus a hand-rolled ARP-cache prime (a UDP socket sent to force an ARP entry, then a direct read of `/proc/net/arp` for containers without `arp`/`ip neighbor`). That approach needed an executor hop to stay off the event loop, returned nothing on a cold ARP cache — the drift that left an orphaned gateway device behind — and was documented here as having an **unfixable limitation**: ARP only works within one broadcast domain, so a gateway on another subnet or VLAN could never be identified. That limitation was an artefact of the lookup method, not of the protocol. Asking the device works across subnets, and the `getmac` dependency is gone.

Since the gateway ID's format can change over time (host-based → lowercase MAC → uppercase MAC, in the order the integration has evolved), `_migrate_gateway_device_id()` handles transitions backed by a confirmed MAC lookup. Rather than guessing at specific old id strings, it identifies the old device *structurally*: for a given config entry there is exactly one device with no `via_device` (the root of the gateway/controller/thermostat hierarchy), whatever identifier it currently happens to hold. It renames that device's identifier in place if no device already exists under the new identifier, or safely moves attached entities and child devices before removing a duplicate. The confirmed MAC and the retained registry fallback are stored separately so a failed lookup cannot cause MAC → IP → MAC identifier oscillation, while later polls can still retry resolution.

### Gateway device info (the JNAP surface) — [jnap.py](custom_components/uponorx265/jnap.py)
The gateway speaks JNAP at `http://<host>/JNAP/`, dispatching on an `x-jnap-action` header. Probing every plausible action across the five services it advertises (`attribute`, `core`, `setup`, `update`, `uponorsky`) turns up exactly **three** that answer:

| Action | Returns |
|---|---|
| `http://phyn.com/jnap/uponorsky/GetAttributes` | every variable (~1300) — controllers, thermostats, system settings. The integration's `get_data()`. |
| `http://phyn.com/jnap/core/GetDeviceInfo` | the comm module's own identity — see below. |
| `http://phyn.com/jnap/update/GetFirmwareUpdateSettings` | `{"isAutoFirmwareUpdateEnabled": true}` — the *gateway's* firmware auto-update, distinct from `cust_Enable_SW_Update`, which governs controller firmware distribution. |

`uponorsky/SetAttributes` writes; `uponorsky/GetAttribute` (singular) exists for targeted reads but expects an input schema that has not been worked out, and offers nothing the bulk call does not. Everything else returns `_ErrorUnknownAction`. **There is no separate thermostat or controller dump** — `GetAttributes` is the entire data surface, which is why `dump_raw_data` returning it is genuinely everything available.

`core/GetDeviceInfo` takes an empty payload and returns the fields the attribute set has no equivalent for:

```
deviceID:        AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF          -> the gateway ID, uppercased and de-colonned
serialNumber:    000000XX000000             -> device_info serial_number (the printed one)
hardwareVersion: 1                          -> device_info hw_version
firmwareNumber:  20006006                   -> device_info sw_version; matches the Uponor app
firmwareVersion: Sky_smatrixrelease_2_0_6_6_locked
deviceName / manufacturer / productCode / description / firmwareDate / services
```

`firmwareNumber` and `firmwareVersion` carry the same version in two renderings (`2_0_6_6` -> `20006006`); the app shows the number, so that is what the device page shows. `UponorStateProxy.async_load_device_info()` fetches this once per setup and is best-effort — a gateway that does not answer keeps a fully working attribute set, so a failure must not fail setup. It is deliberately not cached on failure, because the gateway ID depends on it and a later poll must be free to retry.

### Recovering from a gateway IP change — [config_flow.py](custom_components/uponorx265/config_flow.py)
The MAC has always been the gateway device's registry key, so a DHCP move never renamed the device. It did not help the integration *reach* a moved gateway: `CONF_HOST` stays whatever address was typed into the config flow, and a move simply made the entry unavailable.

Three pieces close that gap:

1. `_register_gateway_devices()` records the MAC as a device **connection** (`CONNECTION_NETWORK_MAC`), not only inside the identifier string. HA matches DHCP leases against connections; an identifier is opaque to it.
2. The manifest declares `"dhcp": [{"registered_devices": true}]`, which asks HA to watch leases for MACs this integration has registered — it never triggers for an unknown device.
3. `DomainConfigFlow.async_step_dhcp()` maps the MAC back to the config entry through the device registry and rewrites the host.

The entry's `unique_id` is derived from the user's chosen name, not the MAC, so the usual `_abort_if_unique_id_configured(updates={CONF_HOST: ...})` shortcut cannot find it — the device registry is the only link between the two. A MAC may also be registered by other integrations (a router, a device tracker), so every matching device is examined and only an entry in this domain is touched.

**The host must be written to both `data` and `options`.** `_sync_entry_config()` merges them as `{**FLAG_DEFAULTS, **data, **options}`, so options win; updating `data` alone is silently reverted to the stale address on the next setup.

Limits worth knowing: recovery waits for the next lease renewal, and HA has to be able to observe DHCP traffic at all (fine on HAOS/Supervised, not guaranteed for containers on a bridge network). A gateway on another subnet is not seen either — though note the JNAP MAC read *does* work cross-subnet, so the device identity stays correct there even when this recovery path cannot fire. None of this was possible with the previous ARP-based lookup, which could not produce a MAC to register in exactly those situations.

### Device registration ordering — [__init__.py](custom_components/uponorx265/__init__.py)
Thermostat and controller entities link their device to its parent (controller, then gateway) from their `device_info`. Historically the parent device only ever got created as a side effect of a specific entity — a controller status sensor, gated behind the optional `CONF_CREATE_CONTROLLERS` — which lives in the `SENSOR` platform, loaded *after* `CLIMATE` and `SWITCH` in `PLATFORMS`. HA would log a `via_device` referencing a non-existing device warning and eventually stop honoring it, and if the controller sensor was disabled the parent device was never created at all.

`_register_gateway_devices()` fixes this by registering the gateway and controller devices explicitly in `async_setup_entry`, before `async_forward_entry_setups()` is called — so the parent always exists regardless of platform order or which optional entities are enabled. It falls back to `get_cached_controllers()` (mirroring `get_cached_thermostats()`) when live data isn't loaded yet, e.g. on a warm restart where `async_update()` runs as a background task instead of being awaited.

Ordering became load-bearing rather than merely tidy when the link moved to `via_device_id`. HA 2026.9 deprecated `via_device` (the parent's *identifier tuple*, which the registry resolved for you, tolerating a miss with a log line) in favour of `via_device_id` (the parent's *registry id*), so `device_info` now has to resolve the parent itself — `_via_device_info()` in [helper.py](custom_components/uponorx265/helper.py). A `via_device_id` naming no registered device raises `DeviceInfoError` and the entity platform drops the entity, so an unresolved parent yields no link at all rather than a bad one: a flat device tree, never a missing entity.

### Setpoint storage & restore-on-off — [__init__.py](custom_components/uponorx265/__init__.py) / [climate.py](custom_components/uponorx265/climate.py)
The integration has no real on/off register — "off" is encoded as `setpoint == min_temp` (or `max_temp` in cool mode). The `.storage` file's per-thermostat setpoint memo is therefore the only thing that can restore a room to its pre-off temperature, which makes its read-modify-write path load-bearing:

- **`self._storage_lock`** (`asyncio.Lock`) serialises every storage load and read-modify-write against both `_storage_data` and `_storage_metadata`: `async_turn_off()`, `async_remember_setpoint()`, `async_turn_on()`, and the complete metadata merge/assign/save transaction all take it. A load replaces both in-memory dictionaries, so locking only the final save would still allow an older suspended load to erase a newer update. Without this serialization, concurrent service calls or a discovery refresh can produce a last-writer-wins save that silently discards setpoint memos or discovery metadata.
- **`async_turn_off()`** never memorises the off value (`min_temp`/`max_temp`) itself as the restore target — doing so would permanently strand the room off, since `async_turn_on()` would just write the off value straight back. **`async_turn_on()`** also treats a previously-poisoned memo (one that does equal the off value, e.g. left over from before this fix) as "no memo" and falls back to `DEFAULT_TEMP` instead of restoring it.
- **`async_remember_setpoint()`** backs `UponorClimate.async_set_temperature()` when the room is off: rather than silently discarding the request (the old behavior) or writing the live setpoint through (which would silently turn the room back on, violating `hvac_mode: off`), it records the requested temperature in storage so the next `turn_on` restores exactly what was asked for.

### Entity base — [helper.py](custom_components/uponorx265/helper.py)
Three base classes build a device hierarchy in HA:

| Base class | Device | Parent (`via_device_id`) |
|---|---|---|
| `UponorGatewayEntity` | Gateway (root) | — |
| `UponorControllerEntity` | Controller | Gateway |
| `UponorThermostatEntity` | Thermostat | Controller |

All inherit poll-free behavior (`should_poll = False`) and subscribe to the dispatcher signal for push updates.

### Platform files
One file per HA domain; each reads `hass.data[unique_id]` for the state_proxy + lists of controllers/thermostats and builds entities:

| File | Contents |
|---|---|
| [climate.py](custom_components/uponorx265/climate.py) | The main entity per thermostat (temperature, HVAC mode, presets: Comfort/Eco/Away/HA controlled) |
| [sensor.py](custom_components/uponorx265/sensor.py) | Temperature, humidity, status, relay configuration, pump management, etc. |
| [binary_sensor.py](custom_components/uponorx265/binary_sensor.py) | Valve, pump relay, boiler demand, bypass (read-only) |
| [switch.py](custom_components/uponorx265/switch.py) | Away, cool mode, HA override (dial thermostats), auto-update, bypass (installer mode) |
| [select.py](custom_components/uponorx265/select.py) | Relay configuration and pump management (writable, installer mode) |
| [config_flow.py](custom_components/uponorx265/config_flow.py) | Setup wizard + options flow (host, controller names, room names, feature toggles) |

---

## Testing

A `pytest` suite lives under [tests/](tests/), using `pytest-homeassistant-custom-component` for a real (in-memory) `hass` instance — the JNAP client is always mocked, no real network calls are made. Run with:

```
pip install -r requirements_test.txt
pytest tests/ -v
```

`tests/helpers.py` provides `make_state_proxy()`, which builds a `UponorStateProxy` backed by a mocked `UponorJnap` client and a `hass`-backed `Store`, and `thermostat_data()` for constructing raw `_data` entries at a given setpoint/limits.

The suite is weighted towards regression coverage for bugs found during review rather than exhaustive coverage of the whole integration:

| File | Covers |
|---|---|
| [test_turn_off_storage_race.py](tests/test_turn_off_storage_race.py) | The storage lock — concurrent `async_turn_off()` calls must not lose each other's memo |
| [test_poisoned_memo.py](tests/test_poisoned_memo.py) | The off value is never memorised as a restore target, and a poisoned memo self-heals on `turn_on` |
| [test_set_temperature_while_off.py](tests/test_set_temperature_while_off.py) | `set_temperature` on an off room is remembered, not silently discarded |
| [test_device_registration.py](tests/test_device_registration.py) | Gateway/controller devices exist before platform setup, regardless of `CONF_CREATE_CONTROLLERS` |
| [test_gateway_device_migration.py](tests/test_gateway_device_migration.py) | The gateway device migration finds the old device structurally, including after host-id drift |
| [test_bypass_max_two.py](tests/test_bypass_max_two.py) | The max-2-bypass-zones-per-controller business rule, and that it's per-controller not global |
| [test_thermostat_model_detection.py](tests/test_thermostat_model_detection.py) | The `hwid`/serial-prefix model detection heuristic and its cache fallback |
| [test_installer_mode_entity_cleanup.py](tests/test_installer_mode_entity_cleanup.py) | Toggling `installer_settings` removes the read-only/writable twin it replaces, scoped to its own config entry |
| [test_installer_mode_setup_flow.py](tests/test_installer_mode_setup_flow.py) | The same, end to end through real platform setup — the restore pass depends on `async_forward_entry_setups()` having registered the replacement by the time it returns |

Note on the storage-race test specifically: `pytest-homeassistant-custom-component`'s mocked `Store.async_save` never actually suspends (no executor read, no disk write), so without an explicit forced yield point (`asyncio.sleep(0)` injected into the mock) the test can pass "by accident" on platforms/schedulers where the mocked coroutines happen to run to completion sequentially anyway — masking a regression instead of catching it. The injected yield point makes the test deterministic regardless of platform.

Windows-specific: `tests/conftest.py` neutralises `pytest_socket.disable_socket()`, which `pytest-homeassistant-custom-component` calls unconditionally before every test. On Windows, asyncio's event loop needs a real socketpair for its internal self-pipe, so blocking all sockets breaks fixture setup before any test code runs; since no test here makes real network calls anyway, this is safe to disable rather than fight.

## Functionality

**Core function:** every physical thermostat becomes a `climate` entity with a target temperature, current temperature/humidity, HVAC mode (Heat/Cool + Off), and presets. Dial thermostats (T-144/T-145) require "HA controlled" mode (local override) before HA can control the setpoint.

**Two-tier feature model**, driven by flags in the config entry:
- `controller_io` → creates relay/IO sensors per controller (pump relay, boiler demand)
- `installer_settings` ("Installer mode") → makes relay configuration, bypass, and pump management **writable** (select/switch); otherwise the same data is shown as **read-only sensors**. Both forms share one `unique_id`, but the entity registry is keyed by `(domain, platform, unique_id)` — so the domain change makes them two separate rows, and recorder history cannot follow across the toggle (an `entity_id` cannot change domain). Two passes keep the toggle clean: `_remove_stale_installer_mode_entities` runs before platform setup and deletes the side the current flag no longer creates, capturing the user-owned registry fields off it (name, icon, area, labels, aliases, hidden, and the `object_id`); `_restore_installer_mode_customizations` runs after `async_forward_entry_setups()` and re-applies them to the row that replaced it. So a renamed `binary_sensor.kitchen_bypass` becomes `switch.kitchen_bypass` instead of leaving an unavailable entity behind and coming back as `..._2`.

**Business rules built into the entities:**
- Max 2 active bypass zones per controller (enforced in `BypassEnableSwitch.async_turn_on`, raises `HomeAssistantError` otherwise)
- Pump relay is hidden for C2–C4 when pump management is set to "common"
- Bypass defaults to off

**Multi-gateway support:** multiple config entries can run in parallel; services like `set_variable` and `dump_raw_data` match against the right gateway via `device_id`, or the single configured one if only one exists.

**Migration:** `_migrate_entity_unique_ids` handles historical unique_id format changes (prefix addition, climate suffix) automatically on startup so upgrades don't create duplicates.

## Official Pulse app (reference)

The Uponor Smatrix Pulse app (requires a communication module, see [R-208](#uponor-smatrix-pulse-com-r-208-communication-module)) has the following menu options per thermostat:

- **My ECO profiles** — Comfort/ECO schedule per room
- **Show trends** — history of temperature/humidity over time
- **Room settings** — configuration for the individual room's thermostat

These features live in Uponor's app/cloud and have no equivalent in the integration today — the JNAP gateway doesn't expose ECO profile schedules or historical trend data, only current variable values (see [dump_raw_data](custom_components/uponorx265/__init__.py)).

### Structure under "My ECO profiles"

**System ECO adjustment**
- Global temperature offset for ECO mode, −4 °C to +4 °C.

**Preset profiles**
- 6 of them (ECO profile 1–6), each with:
  - Day selection (which weekdays the profile applies to)
  - 3 time intervals per day, each with an ECO on/off time

**My ECO profiles** (user-defined, per room)
- Each profile has: name (editable), assigned room, Mon–Sun schedule
- "Add ECO" creates a new custom profile

None of these schedules/profiles are represented as HA variables in the data the integration reads via JNAP — they're handled entirely by the app/controller's internal logic.

### Structure under "Room settings"

- **Room name** → change the room's name
- **ECO profile** → assign one of "My ECO profiles" (e.g. "My ECO profile 1") to the room
- **ECO temperature setback** → set the temperature setback for the room, 0.5–10 °C
- **Override thermostat value** → on/off toggle
- **Advanced room settings** →
  - **Max setpoint** → 5–35 °C
  - **Min setpoint** → 5–35 °C
  - **Include in average temperature** → on/off; display value only, doesn't affect operation (ON by default)
  - **Comfort setting** → 0–12%, baseline comfort level when there's no heating demand (shortens heat-up time, e.g. with another heat source like a wood stove — the value is the fraction of time the actuators are held open)
  - **Floor temperature** (display) plus **Maximum/Minimum floor temperature** (limits, only in RFT control mode)

Comparison against the integration:
- **Max/Min setpoint** already corresponds to `get_max_limit()` / `get_min_limit()` in [climate.py](custom_components/uponorx265/climate.py) (`min_temp`/`max_temp` properties).
- **ECO temperature setback** corresponds to `get_eco_setback()`, exposed via `UponorClimate.extra_state_attributes`.
- **Include in average temperature** corresponds to the `ClimatControlInAvg` switch (`avg_included`, controlled by `get_inavg()`/`async_iset_inavg()`) in [switch.py](custom_components/uponorx265/switch.py), gated behind `CONF_SWITCH_SENSOR_AVG`.
- **ECO profile, Room name, Override thermostat value, Comfort setting, Floor temperature limits** have no equivalent in the integration today — not available via the JNAP variables it reads.

### System settings / installer settings in the app

Accessed via the app's side menu → "System settings", or specifically "Installer settings" (warning text: *"Changing these settings may cause your system to stop working correctly"*).

- **Cooling** → enable cooling mode in the system (disabled at delivery); then gives access to cooling settings
- **GPI configuration** → sets which signal type the controller's GPI (general purpose input) accepts: **Comfort/ECO switching** or **General system alarm** (heat/cool switching requires the system to have heating/cooling; automatically disabled if an external Comfort/ECO switch, e.g. a T-143 registered as a system device, is already connected)
- **Pump management** → **Individual** (one circulation pump per controller, connected to relay 1) or **Common** (one pump for the whole system, connected to the master controller's relay 1 — the relays on slave controllers then become available for other functions)
- **Controller relays** → two independent relays (Relay 1 / Relay 2) per controller, with predefined combinations:
  - **Master controller:** Circulation pump+Boiler (default) · Circulation pump+Heat/cool switching · Circulation pump+Dehumidifier · Cooling unit+Boiler · Circulation pump+Comfort/ECO · Not configured+Not configured
  - **Slave controller** (requires communication module): Circulation pump+Heat/cool switching · Circulation pump+Dehumidifier · Not configured+Not configured
- **Bypass room** → the system handles bypass for **up to two rooms per controller** (to maintain minimum flow); rooms are chosen manually per controller tab, or with a time limit for the bypass function
- **Valve/pump exercise** → prevents circulation pumps/actuators from seizing up during extended inactivity. By default: every 6th day ±24 h, the pump runs for 3 minutes, the actuators are fully opened/closed. Runs independently per component, only if the component hasn't been used since the last exercise
- **Autobalancing** → **Enabled** (default) or **Disabled**; controls the actuator outputs via pulse-width modulation (PWM) instead of simple on/off signals, giving more even floor temperatures, faster response time, and lower energy consumption. Can be combined with pre-balancing
- **Installation name** → free text field
- **Low average temperature limit** → triggers an alarm if the system's average temperature (calculated from rooms flagged "Include in average temperature") falls below the threshold. Default 10 °C (5–30 °C), plus hysteresis, default 5 °C (1–10 °C); the alarm clears when the average temperature rises above threshold + hysteresis
- **System information** → list of all connected devices (controller, communication module, thermostats) with model, software version, and ID, plus the ability to trigger an update
- **Supply temp. control** → on/off toggle (supply water temperature monitoring)

Comparison against the integration:
- **Pump management** (Individual/Common) corresponds exactly to `PumpManagementSelect`/`get_pump_management()`/`sys_pump_management` in [select.py](custom_components/uponorx265/select.py) and [__init__.py](custom_components/uponorx265/__init__.py) — the same `"0"`/`"1"` values.
- **Controller relays** corresponds to `ControllerRelayConfigSelect`/`get_controller_relayconfig()` (`C?_controller_relays_config`) in the same files; the integration's `RELAY_CONFIG_OPTIONS` (`not_in_use`/`pump_heater`/`pump_eco_comfort`/`not_configured`) is a simplified subset of the app's combination table.
- **Bypass room, max 2 per controller** confirms exactly the business rule already hardcoded in `BypassEnableSwitch.async_turn_on` ([switch.py](custom_components/uponorx265/switch.py)) — the app's limit and the integration's limit are therefore identical.
- **Cooling, GPI configuration, Valve/pump exercise, Autobalancing, Low average temperature limit, Installation name, System information, Supply temp. control** have no equivalent in the integration today.

## Raw data (JNAP variables)

The `dump_raw_data` service returns the entire `_data` dictionary as-is — every `waspVarName`/`waspVarValue` pair the gateway exposes. The variable names follow a few clear prefix patterns:

| Prefix | Level | Example | Contents |
|---|---|---|---|
| `cust_*` | Gateway/customer | `cust_Controller1_Name`, `cust_C1_T1_name`, `cust_wifi_device`, `cust_ip_device`, `cust_Enable_SW_Update`, `cust_General_RH_Setpoint`, `cust_Low_temperature_Limit` | Names (controllers, rooms), network, firmware update, alarm limits |
| `sys_*` | System | `sys_pump_management`, `sys_autobalance`, `sys_heat_cool_mode`, `sys_time_limit_bypass`, `sys_day`/`sys_Month`/`sys_year`/…, `sys_controller_?_presence` | Global operating settings, system clock, which controllers are connected |
| `C?_*` (no `T?`) | Controller | `C1_controller_relays_config`, `C1_stat_pump_relay`, `C1_stat_demand`, `C1_output_module_configuration`, `C1_general_purpose_input`, `C1_average_room_temperature`, `C1_sw_version` | Relay configuration, pump/boiler status, GPI, average temperature, software version, alarms |
| `C?_T?_*` | Thermostat | `C1_T1_setpoint`, `C1_T1_room_temperature`, `C1_T1_eco_setting`, `C1_T1_bypass_enable`, `C1_T1_eco_profile_number`, `C1_T1_stat_*_error` | Setpoint/room temperature, ECO settings, bypass, error statuses per thermostat |
| `C?_T?_<Weekday>` | Thermostat, schedule | `C1_T1_Monday` … `C1_T1_Sunday` | 12-character hex bitmask per weekday — the schedule for the ECO profile assigned to the room |
| `controller?_id`, `C?_thermostat?_id`, `C?_TTH_?_id` | Identities | `controller1_id`, `C1_thermostat1_id` | Hardware IDs for controllers, thermostats, and external TTH sensors |

**Correction to an earlier note:** the ECO profiles' weekly schedule is actually available in the raw data via the `C?_T?_<Weekday>` bitmasks (e.g. `C1_T1_Monday: c0ffffffffff`) together with `C?_T?_eco_profile_number` and `cust_C?_T?_Custom_Eco_Profile`. What's missing isn't the data itself, but an interpretation/exposure of it in the integration — the bitmask format isn't decoded anywhere in the code today.

Other observations from the dump:
- `sys_pump_management: '1'` (common) and `C1_controller_relays_config: '3'` / `C2_controller_relays_config: '1'` show `pump_heater` on C1 and `not_in_use` on C2 — matches the rule that C2's pump relay is hidden when pump management is common.
- `C1_stat_pump_relay` and `C1_stat_demand` are boolean strings (`'0'`/`'1'`), as expected by `get_pump_relay()`/`get_boiler_demand()`.
- Temperature values (`setpoint`, `room_temperature`, etc.) are stored as integers in tenths of a degree (e.g. `692` = 20.5 °C), `32767` means "not connected/no value".
- `C1_general_purpose_input: '3'` and `C1_output_module_configuration: '7'` are separate bitfields from `controller_relays_config` — not the same thing as the relay configuration choice in the app.

## Supported hardware

The integration supports the **Uponor Smatrix Wave Pulse (X-265)** and **Uponor Smatrix Base Pulse (X-245)** systems. The controller (X-265/X-245) is the gateway the integration speaks JNAP with. The thermostats become `climate` entities in HA; the dial models T-144/T-145 (see [const.py](custom_components/uponorx265/const.py) `DIAL_THERMOSTAT_MODELS`) require "HA controlled" mode for remote setpoint control.

### Thermostat model identification

The Smatrix ranges run in parallel — Base Pulse (X-245) has T-141/143/144/145/146/148/149,
Wave Pulse (X-265) has T-161/162/163/165/166/168/169 — and the paired models
(T-146↔T-166, T-148↔T-168, T-149↔T-169) report the **same** `C?_T?_thermostat_type`. So that
code alone can never name a model. Identification is therefore two steps: resolve the product
series, then read the thermostat's own hardware type within it.

**Step 1 — the series** (`get_product_series()`):

1. `cust_SW_version_update` is the controller's firmware image name and states the model
   outright: `X265_121.hex` → Wave, `X245_122.hex` → Base. This is a read, not an inference,
   so it is tried first.
2. Failing that, `C?_hardware_type`: `1` → Wave, `0` → Base. Agrees with the firmware name on
   every system observed.

**Step 2 — the model** (`_detect_thermostat_model()`), keyed on `(series, C?_T?_hw_type)`:

| series | `hw_type` | model | evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Wave | `7` | T-169 | owner-confirmed, [issue #36](https://github.com/dave-code-ruiz/uponorX265/issues/36) (16 units); second Wave system in `homey-uponor` `examples/output_3.json` |
| Base | `3` | T-146 | `homey-uponor` `examples/output_1.json`; matches the owner-confirmed T-146 profile in [issue #29](https://github.com/dave-code-ruiz/uponorX265/issues/29) |

`thermostat_type == 0` is the dial family. T-144 and T-145 share both `thermostat_type` and
`hw_type`, so the serial number is still the only thing separating them: prefix `269` with last
digit `1` = T-144, everything else on a **Base** system = T-145 (the same thing Uponor's own app
appears to do when it cannot tell). That rule is field-confirmed on Base units only, so it is not
applied to a Wave system — a Wave dial (T-165) has never been observed and reports no model
rather than borrowing a Base label.

**Anything not in the table returns `None`.** A device with no model shown is strictly better
than one confidently mislabelled: before this, every `thermostat_type == 2` unit on every system
was reported as T-146, including sixteen T-169s. Unrecognised units are logged at DEBUG with
their full signature (series, `thermostat_type`, `hw_type`, serial prefix, capability flags) so
they can be reported and mapped. `dump_hardware_info` exposes the same fields as a service
response.

> **These codes are not documented by Uponor.** The table is derived from field data across five

Model detection is **not** keyed on humidity or floor-temperature readings. `has_humidity_sensor()`
is `C?_T?_rh != 0` and `has_floor_temperature()` is `C?_T?_external_temperature != 32767` — both
report what a unit is currently *sensing*, not what it is *capable of*. A T-146 with no RH sensor
and a T-169 sitting at 0% RH are indistinguishable that way, and a floor sensor that simply is not
wired reads identically to a model that cannot take one. They remain fine as heuristics for
deciding which entities to create; they are not evidence of a model.

**Controller model.** `get_controller_hardware()` returns X-265 or X-245 from the same series
resolution. The controller serial prefix does *not* discriminate: `4194` has been observed on both
Wave and Base controllers across four systems. Note also that the gateway device's model is
`R-208`, the communication module — correct, but shared by both Pulse families, so it carries no
series information either.

### Component descriptions (from Uponor's installation manual)

<details>
<summary><strong>Uponor Smatrix Base Pulse X-245</strong> (controller)</summary>

- Integrated Dynamic Energy Management (DEM) features, e.g. autobalancing (enabled by default). Other DEM features (comfort setting, room bypass, supply temperature monitoring) require the Pulse app (communication module) and in some cases Uponor's cloud services.
- Electronic actuator control, up to eight actuators (24 V AC).
- Two-way communication with up to six room thermostats.
- Heat/cool switching (advanced) and/or Comfort/ECO via closing contact, public-environment thermostat, or the Pulse app.
- Separate relays for pump and boiler control; other control functions require a communication module + app.
- Valve and pump exercise. Relative humidity control (requires the Pulse app).
- Control of combined floor heating/cooling and ceiling cooling (requires a communication module + app).
- ECO mode lowers indoor temp (heating) / raises it (cooling); activated globally via closing contact, public-environment thermostat, or the app, or per room via a programmable thermostat/ECO profiles.
- Options: communication module for app connectivity (remote access requires Uponor's cloud services); extension module (+6 thermostat channels, +6 actuator outputs); star module (+8 bus connections); up to four controllers in one system (requires a communication module + app); modular placement with a detachable transformer; cabinet/wall mounting (DIN rail or screws); free placement/orientation (the communication module must, however, be mounted vertically).

<summary><strong>Uponor Smatrix Pulse Com R-208</strong> (communication module)</summary>

- Provides Uponor Smatrix Pulse app connectivity via Wi-Fi or Ethernet — this is the module that exposes the JNAP gateway the integration talks to.
- Extra features via the app: heat/cool settings, additional relay functions (cooling unit, dehumidifier, etc.).
- Can integrate up to four controllers in one system.
- Cabinet or wall mounting (DIN rail or included screws).

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Uponor Smatrix Base M-242</strong> (extension module)</summary>

- Only one extension module per controller.
- Plug-in installation into an existing controller, no extra wiring needed.
- Registers up to six extra thermostats and connects up to six extra actuators (24 V).
- Electronic control, valve exercise.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Uponor Smatrix Base M-243</strong> (star module)</summary>

- Only one star module per bus type (thermostat and/or system bus) per controller; a star module only handles one bus type at a time.
- Enables star-topology wiring instead of a bus network — more flexible cable routing.
- Requires a Base Pulse controller. Adds 8 extra bus connections. Only inputs from thermostats are allowed.
- Connects directly to the controller or extension module with a communication cable.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Uponor Smatrix Base T-141</strong> (room sensor thermostat)</summary>

- As small as possible while still controlling room temperature.
- Occupancy temperature sensor for improved comfort.
- Setpoint adjustable via the app (requires a communication module), 5–35 °C.
- Relative humidity threshold shown in the app (requires a communication module).

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Uponor Smatrix Base T-143</strong> (thermostat for public environments)</summary>

- Dial hidden — must be removed from the wall to set the temperature; triggers a tamper alarm when removed (if enabled, also shown in the app with a communication module).
- Can be registered as a system device — this disables the internal room sensor and unlocks extra functions.
- Setpoint 5–35 °C via a potentiometer on the back.
- Closing contact input for forced ECO mode (as a system device).
- Optional extra outdoor temperature sensor; floor temperature limits only configurable via the app.
- DIP switch for function/sensor mode and for enabling the Comfort/ECO schedule.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Uponor Smatrix Base T-144</strong> (recessed thermostat)</summary>

- Specifically designed for wall mounting (recessed installation), large dial with printed scale, 21 °C marked.
- Max/min temperature only settable via the app. Setpoint 5–35 °C.
- LED indication (~60 s) on heating/cooling demand.
- DIP switch under the dial for Comfort/ECO scheduling.
- Different mounting frames available for switch-plate frames.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Uponor Smatrix Base T-145</strong> (standard thermostat)</summary>

- Large dial with printed scale, 21 °C marked, LED ring indicates setpoint change while turning.
- Max/min temperature only settable via the app. Setpoint 5–35 °C.
- LED in the lower right corner indicates (~60 s) heating/cooling demand.
- DIP switch on the back for Comfort/ECO scheduling.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Uponor Smatrix Base T-146</strong> (digital thermostat with display)</summary>

- Backlit display (turns off after 10 s of inactivity), shows °C/°F, calibratable room temperature, shows heating/cooling demand and software version on startup.
- Setpoint 5–35 °C. Support for external temperature sensors (optional).
- Comfort/ECO scheduling requires the Pulse app. Adjustable ECO temperature setback.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Uponor Smatrix Base T-148</strong> (programmable digital thermostat)</summary>

- Display shows room temperature, setpoint, or relative humidity, plus the current time.
- Recommended only in systems **without** a communication module — its own scheduling function is disabled if a communication module is present in the system.
- Installation wizard for time/date, 12/24h clock, internal memory to survive power outages.
- Setpoint 5–35 °C, support for external temperature sensors.
- Programmable Comfort/ECO switching with its own ECO value; T-148 cannot be overridden by other system settings once programmed.
- Humidity threshold alarm on the display (requires a communication module).
