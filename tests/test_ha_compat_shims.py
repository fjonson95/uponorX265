"""The pre-HA-2026.8 fallbacks in the device-registry compat shims must work.

Three registry APIs changed in HA 2026.8/2026.9: `async_get_device` gave way
to `async_get_device_by_identifier` for identifier lookups and to
`async_get_devices` for connection lookups, and `async_get_or_create`'s
`via_device` (a parent identifier tuple) gave way to `via_device_id` (the
parent's registry id). All the old forms break in HA 2027.8.

The integration prefers the new APIs and falls back to the old ones on cores
older than 2026.8. Nothing else covers those fallback branches — on a current
core they are dead code until an old-HA user hits them — so these tests force
each fallback and assert it resolves the same device / builds the same
hierarchy as the modern path.

Both old APIs still function (deprecated) on HA 2026.8, so the fallbacks stay
exercisable there. HA 2026.9 promotes both to a hard RuntimeError, which makes
the branches unreachable rather than wrong - so these tests skip themselves on
such a core (see the autouse fixture below). Run against HA 2026.8 to cover
them.

They are reached here through integration code rather than called directly
from the test, which also matches how HA reports the deprecation: a
custom-integration frame downgrades it to a log line, whereas a direct call
from test code raises outright.
